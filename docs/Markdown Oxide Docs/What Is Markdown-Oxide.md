    # What is Markdown-Oxide
    
    Markdown-Oxide is a [[PKMS|PKMS]] that composes with your favorite text-editor through the [[LSP|LSP]].
    
    While other [[PKMS|PKMS]] implementations include their own text-editors, markdown-oxide is *unbundled*: it leaves text-editing to a dedicated text-editor and focuses solely on robust, performant knowledge management.
